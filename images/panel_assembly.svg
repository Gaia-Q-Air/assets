# Panel Assembly Diagram

This document provides a formal technical description of the **Panel Assembly** as represented in the accompanying SVG schematic (`panel_assembly.svg`). The diagram is intended for use in aerospace system documentation, supporting configuration management, manufacturing, and maintenance operations.

## 1. Diagram Overview

The SVG schematic depicts a primary panel structure, a subordinate filler panel, and designated mounting or fastener points. All graphical callouts are enumerated for unambiguous reference in part lists and work instructions.

## 2. Component Key

| Callout | Description                          |
|---------|--------------------------------------|
| 1       | Main Panel Assembly                  |
| 2       | Filler Panel (subassembly/component) |
| 3       | Mounting/Fastener Locations          |
| 4       | Reference Border/Outline             |
| 5       | Special Reference or Datum Point     |

## 3. Notes

- The filler panel (2) is designed to attach directly to the main panel assembly (1).
- Mounting/fastener locations (3) are symmetrically positioned at the corners of the main panel.
- The outer reference border (4) is for alignment or clearance verification.
- The special reference (5) denotes a datum or critical inspection point as per engineering requirements.

## 4. Usage

- This schematic is used for assembly procedures, configuration audits, and technical publications.
- All referenced items comply with aerospace engineering standards for documentation, including revision control and traceability.
- The SVG format ensures scalability and precision for electronic technical manuals (ETMs) and digital twin integration.
