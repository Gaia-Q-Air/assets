### 12. Quantum-Enhanced Tolerance Optimization

* Quantum algorithms analyzed >10,000 stack-up scenarios for tolerance allocation
* High-stress regions receive tighter tolerances via quantum-enhanced FEA
* Tolerances matched to manufacturing capability/certification
* Weight optimization considered
* All specs are digital-twin linked for as-built vs. as-designed validation

---

### 13. Inspection Requirements

* **Measurement Equipment**

  * CMM: ±0.005 mm (critical features)
  * Laser: ±0.05 mm (profile)
  * Optical: ±0.01 mm (surface)
* **Inspection Frequency**

  * 100% inspection for critical features (★)
  * SPC for non-critical
  * First article inspection required
* **Inspection Documentation**

  * Results in digital twin
  * Deviations >80% of tolerance → engineering review
  * Non-conformances per GAIA-QAO-PROC-NCR-2025-002
